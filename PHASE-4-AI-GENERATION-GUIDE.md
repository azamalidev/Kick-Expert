## üß† Prompt Engineering

### System Prompt
```
You are a professional football (soccer) trivia question generator.
Generate high-quality, accurate, and engaging football trivia questions.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Questions must be factually accurate
2. All 4 answer choices must be plausible (no obviously wrong answers)
3. Only ONE choice should be correct
4. Provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for the correct answer
5. Use proper grammar and formatting
6. Questions should test real football knowledge
7. Avoid overly obscure or trick questions
8. Include a mix of topics: players, teams, tournaments, history, records, tactics, etc.
```

### User Prompt Structure
1. **Total questions** and difficulty distribution
2. **Category** and **topic** context (if provided)
3. **JSON structure specification** with example
4. **Critical reminders**: correct_answer must match a choice, difficulty counts

### Why GPT-4o-mini?
- **Cost-efficient**: ~15x cheaper than GPT-4
- **Fast**: 2-5 second response times
- **Quality**: Sufficient for structured question generation
- **Upgrade option**: Change `model: 'gpt-4o-mini'` to `model: 'gpt-4'` in route.ts

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-api-key-here
```

### Model Configuration

In `app/api/admin/questions/generate-ai/route.ts`:

```typescript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini',        // Change to 'gpt-4' for better quality
  temperature: 0.8,             // 0.0-1.0: lower = consistent, higher = creative
  max_tokens: 4000,             // Enough for 50 questions
  response_format: { type: 'json_object' }, // Force JSON response
});
```

### Quality Thresholds

Validation checks in API:
- **Question text**: 10-1000 characters
- **Choices**: All 4 must be present and non-empty
- **Correct answer**: Must exactly match one of the 4 choices
- **Difficulty**: Must be 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard'

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "OpenAI API key not configured" | Missing or invalid API key | Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local` |
| "Rate limit exceeded" | Too many API requests | Wait 60 seconds or upgrade OpenAI plan |
| "Total questions must be between 1 and 50" | Invalid input | Enter a number between 1-50 |
| "Difficulty ratios must sum to 100%" | Invalid ratio | Click "Auto Adjust" or manually fix |
| "No valid questions generated" | API returned malformed data | Try again or check API status |
| "Failed to upload questions" | Database error | Check Supabase connection |

### Validation Errors

If some generated questions fail validation:
- API returns `validationErrors` array
- Only valid questions are returned
- Common issues:
  - Correct answer doesn't match any choice
  - Missing required fields
  - Invalid difficulty value

**Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "questions": [ /* 18 valid questions */ ],
  "generated": 18,
  "requested": 20,
  "validationErrors": [
    "Question 5: correct_answer doesn't match any choice",
    "Question 12: Missing choice_4"
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Custom Prompt Engineering

To modify the AI behavior, edit `route.ts`:

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are a professional football trivia generator.
CUSTOM RULES:
- Focus on modern football (2000-present)
- Include more tactical questions
- Prioritize European leagues
...`;
```

### Changing the AI Model

```typescript
// In route.ts, line ~119
model: 'gpt-4',              // Use GPT-4 instead
temperature: 0.7,            // Lower temperature for consistency
```

### Batch Generation Script

For generating large question sets:

```typescript
// scripts/bulk-generate.ts
async function generateBatch() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    const response = await fetch('/api/admin/questions/generate-ai', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        totalQuestions: 50,
        difficultyRatio: { easy: 40, medium: 40, hard: 20 },
        category: 'General',
      }),
    });
    // Process and upload...
    await delay(5000); // Rate limiting
  }
}
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- ‚úÖ API key stored in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- ‚úÖ Key only accessible server-side (Next.js API routes)
- ‚úÖ Never exposed to client-side JavaScript

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing request throttling
- Track usage per admin user
- Set daily generation limits

### Content Moderation
- Always review AI-generated content
- Check for inappropriate or incorrect answers
- Verify factual accuracy (especially for history/records)

---

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Current Performance
- **Generation time**: 5-15 seconds for 20 questions
- **Token usage**: ~2,000-3,000 tokens per 20 questions
- **Database insert**: < 1 second for 50 questions

### Optimization Tips
1. **Batch uploads**: Upload 30-50 questions at once
2. **Cache categories**: Reuse category context across generations
3. **Parallel generation**: Generate multiple batches simultaneously (watch rate limits)
4. **Response streaming**: Use OpenAI streaming for real-time previews

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution:**
1. Check `.env.local` file exists in root directory
2. Verify variable name is exactly `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Restart Next.js dev server after adding key
4. Run: `npm run dev` again

### Issue: Questions not uploading to database
**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase connection
2. Verify CSV upload API endpoint is working
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify target table name matches database schema

### Issue: Generated questions have wrong difficulty
**Solution:**
1. AI doesn't always respect ratios exactly due to rounding
2. Distribution may be off by 1-2 questions
3. Review and manually adjust difficulty in database if needed

### Issue: Rate limit errors
**Solution:**
1. Wait 60 seconds between generations
2. Reduce total questions per request
3. Upgrade OpenAI API plan for higher limits
4. Use GPT-4o-mini (higher rate limits than GPT-4)

---

## üìù Best Practices

### Content Quality
1. **Always review AI output** before uploading
2. **Edit explanations** to match your tone/style
3. **Verify factual accuracy** (dates, statistics, records)
4. **Check for bias** toward certain leagues/players
5. **Diversify topics** across categories

### Generation Strategy
1. **Start small**: Generate 10-20 questions to test
2. **Use specific topics**: Better results than generic "General"
3. **Mix difficulties**: Don't generate all easy or all hard
4. **Iterate prompts**: Modify system prompt based on results
5. **Track costs**: Monitor OpenAI usage dashboard

### Database Management
1. **Tag AI-generated questions**: Add metadata field
2. **Track performance**: Monitor AI vs. human-written question stats
3. **A/B test**: Compare AI questions to manually created ones
4. **Regular audits**: Review and remove low-performing AI questions
