# 🔒 Browser Fingerprinting & Device Tracking System

## Overview
This system enforces "1 device per user" policy across the entire application using browser fingerprinting technology. It prevents users from creating multiple accounts on the same device and competing in the same competition with different accounts.

---

## 🎯 Implementation Details

### Step 2: Browser Fingerprinting (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Enforce "1 session per device" and stop duplicate users

**Technology:** FingerprintJS - Industry-standard browser fingerprinting library

## 🔧 Core Functions

### `getBrowserFingerprint()`
Generates unique device ID using FingerprintJS
```typescript
const { fingerprintId, components, confidence } = await getBrowserFingerprint();
```

**Returns:**
- `fingerprintId`: Unique 20-character hash (e.g., "Vh8vgJN3k4P2wQxR5tYu")
- `components`: Browser characteristics used
- `confidence`: Accuracy score

### `getDeviceInfo()`
Collects comprehensive device information
```typescript
const deviceInfo = getDeviceInfo();
```

**Captures:**
- Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera)
- OS (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
- Device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
- Screen resolution
- Language
- Timezone
- Platform

### `getIPAddress()`
Fetches user's public IP address
```typescript
const ip = await getIPAddress(); // "192.168.1.100"
```

### `checkFingerprintConflict()`
Checks if device is already registered to another user
```typescript
const conflict = await checkFingerprintConflict(
  fingerprintId,
  userId,
  competitionId
);

if (conflict.conflict) {
  // Block access
}
```

### `saveBrowserFingerprint()`
Saves fingerprint to database
```typescript
await saveBrowserFingerprint(
  competitionId,
  userId,
  fingerprintId,
  deviceInfo,
  ipAddress
);
```

### `handleFingerprintCheck()`
Main function - checks and registers device
```typescript
const result = await handleFingerprintCheck(
  competitionId,
  userId,
  sessionId
);

if (!result.allowed) {
  // Access denied
}
```

---

## 📊 Database Structure

### Table: `competition_browser_fingerprints`

```sql
CREATE TABLE competition_browser_fingerprints (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  competition_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  fingerprint_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_agent TEXT,
  ip_address TEXT,
  device_info JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(competition_id, user_id, fingerprint_id)
);
```

**Sample Record:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "competition_id": "uuid-123",
  "user_id": "uuid-456",
  "fingerprint_id": "Vh8vgJN3k4P2wQxR5tYu",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "device_info": {
    "browser": "Chrome",
    "os": "Windows",
    "deviceType": "Desktop",
    "screenResolution": "1920x1080",
    "language": "en-US",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-10-12T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### On Login:
```
User logs in
    ↓
Generate fingerprint
    ↓
Collect device info
    ↓
Get IP address
    ↓
Save to database (competition_id: "global_login")
    ↓
Continue to dashboard
```

### On Competition Join:
```
User tries to join competition
    ↓
Generate fingerprint
    ↓
Check if fingerprint exists for another user in THIS competition
    ↓
If conflict → Block + Log cheat action
    ↓
If clean → Save fingerprint + Allow entry
```

## 🔍 Detection Scenarios

### Scenario A: Legitimate User
```
User A logs in from Device 1 → ✅ Fingerprint saved
User A joins Competition 1 → ✅ Allowed (first time)
User A joins Competition 2 → ✅ Allowed (same user, different comp)
```

### Scenario B: Multiple Accounts (BLOCKED)
```
User A logs in from Device 1 → ✅ Fingerprint saved
User A joins Competition 1 → ✅ Allowed

User B logs in from Device 1 → ✅ Fingerprint saved (same device!)
User B joins Competition 1 → 🚫 BLOCKED!
  → Error: "This device is already being used by another account"
  → Logged to competition_cheat_actions
```

### Scenario C: Same User, Different Devices
```
User A logs in from Device 1 → ✅ Allowed
User A joins Competition 1 from Device 1 → ✅ Allowed

User A logs in from Device 2 → ✅ Allowed (different fingerprint)
User A joins Competition 1 from Device 2 → ✅ Allowed (same user)
```

## ⚠️ Cheat Detection & Logging

When duplicate device detected:
```typescript
await logFingerprintCheat(
  competitionId,
  userId,
  sessionId,
  fingerprintId,
  conflictDetails
);
```

**Logged to:** `competition_cheat_actions`
```json
{
  "competition_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "action_type": "duplicate_device",
  "details": {
    "fingerprint_id": "Vh8vgJN3k4P2wQxR5tYu",
    "conflict": {
      "existingUser": "uuid-of-other-user"
    }
  },
  "detected_at": "2025-10-12T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🎨 User Experience

### Blocked User Sees:
```
❌ This device is already being used by another account 
   in this competition. Multiple accounts per device 
   are not allowed.

Redirecting to competitions list...
```

### Console Logs (Developer):
```
🔍 Checking device fingerprint...
✅ Device verified: Vh8vgJN3k4P2wQxR5tYu

OR

🚫 Device conflict detected!
🚨 Logging cheat action: duplicate_device

## 📈 Query Examples

### Check User's Devices:
```sql
SELECT 
  fingerprint_id,
  device_info->>'browser' as browser,
  device_info->>'os' as os,
  ip_address,
  created_at
FROM competition_browser_fingerprints
WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Find Duplicate Devices:
```sql
SELECT 
  fingerprint_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as user_count,
  array_agg(DISTINCT user_id) as users
FROM competition_browser_fingerprints
WHERE competition_id = 'comp-uuid'
GROUP BY fingerprint_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) > 1;
```

### Cheat Actions Log:
```sql
SELECT * FROM competition_cheat_actions
WHERE action_type = 'duplicate_device'
ORDER BY detected_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## ✅ Benefits

✅ **Prevents Multi-Accounting** - Same device can't join competition twice with different accounts
✅ **Fair Competition** - One person = one entry
✅ **Comprehensive Tracking** - Full device and network information
✅ **Automatic Detection** - No manual review needed
✅ **Graceful Degradation** - If fingerprinting fails, user can still access (logged)
✅ **Privacy Compliant** - No personal data, only device characteristics
✅ **Cross-Browser** - Works on all major browsers
✅ **Mobile Compatible** - Works on phones and tablets

---

## 🚧 Limitations

1. **VPN/Proxy**: Users can change IP to appear as different device (mitigated by fingerprint)
2. **Incognito Mode**: Different fingerprint in private browsing (acceptable trade-off)
3. **VM/Docker**: Multiple virtual machines = different fingerprints (rare for regular users)
4. **Browser Updates**: Major updates may change fingerprint (rare, tracked separately)
