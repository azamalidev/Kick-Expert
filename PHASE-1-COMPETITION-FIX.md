# Phase 1 - Competition Questions Fixes Applied

## Date: October 14, 2025

## 🔧 Issues Found in Competition Questions

The same issues found in Free Quiz were also present in Competition Questions:

1. **Premature Question Marking** - Questions marked as "used" when fetched from API (before user sees them)
2. **Incorrect Skip Detection** - `was_skipped` logic was backwards (always false when answer submitted)
3. **Response Time Already Working** - Competition already had proper response time tracking ✅

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **API Route** (`app/api/competition-questions/route.ts`)

**REMOVED** premature marking of questions as used:

```typescript
// ❌ OLD - Marked all questions as used when fetched
for (const q of finalQs) {
  await supabase.rpc('mark_question_as_used', {
    p_competition_question_id: q.id
  });
}

// ✅ NEW - Don't mark questions here, wait until they're displayed
// Marking moved to league.tsx when question actually shown to user
```

### 2. **League Component** (`components/league.tsx`)

#### A. Added Question Marking on Display

```typescript
// Timer for each question - using timestamp to work even when tab is inactive
useEffect(() => {
  if (phase !== 'quiz' || quizCompleted || showResult || questions.length === 0) return;

  // ✅ Mark the current question as used (displayed to user)
  const currentQuestion = questions[currentQuestionIndex];
  if (currentQuestion) {
    const markAsUsed = async () => {
      try {
        const competitionQuestionId = (currentQuestion as any).competition_question_id;
        
        if (competitionQuestionId) {
          await supabase.rpc('mark_question_as_used', {
            p_competition_question_id: competitionQuestionId
          });
        }
      } catch (err) {
        console.error('Failed to mark question as used:', err);
      }
    };
    markAsUsed();
  }

  // Set the start time for this question...
}, [phase, quizCompleted, showResult, questions.length, currentQuestionIndex, ...]);
```

#### B. Fixed Skip Detection Logic

```typescript
// ❌ OLD - was_skipped always false when answer submitted
const isCorrect = selectedChoice === currentQuestion?.correct_answer;
// ... later in code
was_skipped: !selectedChoice  // This is always false here!

// ✅ NEW - Properly detect skipped questions
const wasSkipped = !selectedChoice;  // Determine BEFORE using selectedChoice
const isCorrect = selectedChoice === currentQuestion?.correct_answer;
// ... later in code
was_skipped: wasSkipped  // Now correctly true/false
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Competition Question Stats Should Now Show:

| Scenario | times_answered | times_skipped | response_time_ms |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| User answers question | 1 | 0 | 2000-5000 |
| User skips question (timer expires) | 0 | 1 | 0 or null |
| User answers 3 times | 3 | 0 | average time |

### What Changed:

1. **`last_used_at`** - Now updates only when question is **displayed** to user (not when fetched)
2. **`times_answered`** - Correctly increments when user selects an answer
3. **`times_skipped`** - Correctly increments when user doesn't select an answer
4. **`avg_response_time_ms`** - Already working, tracks time from display to answer

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Clean Up Bad Data

```sql
-- Delete incorrect stats from previous tests
DELETE FROM question_stats 
WHERE competition_question_id IS NOT NULL 
AND times_answered = 0;
```

### 2. Restart Dev Server

```powershell
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev

# Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+F5
```

### 3. Test Competition Flow

1. **Register for a competition**
2. **Join and start quiz**
3. **Answer 2-3 questions** (mix of correct/incorrect)
4. **Skip 1-2 questions** (let timer expire)
5. **Complete competition**

### 4. Verify Database

```sql
-- Check competition question stats
SELECT 
  cq.id,
  cq.question_text,
  qs.times_used,
  qs.times_answered,
  qs.times_skipped,
  qs.times_correct,
  qs.correct_percentage,
  qs.avg_response_time_ms,
  qs.last_updated
FROM competition_questions cq
LEFT JOIN question_stats qs ON qs.competition_question_id = cq.id
WHERE cq.competition_id = 'YOUR_COMPETITION_ID'
ORDER BY qs.last_updated DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ `times_answered` should match number of questions you answered
- ✅ `times_skipped` should match number of questions you skipped
- ✅ `avg_response_time_ms` should be > 0 for answered questions
- ✅ `last_used_at` should be updated in `competition_questions` table

### 5. Verify Admin Panel

1. Go to **Admin Dashboard → Questions**
2. Switch to **Competition Questions** tab
3. Click **Refresh Stats** button
4. Stats should display correctly with color coding

## 🔄 Summary of All Phase 1 Changes

### Files Modified:

1. ✅ `components/Quiz.tsx` - Free quiz tracking fixed
2. ✅ `components/league.tsx` - Competition tracking fixed
3. ✅ `app/api/competition-questions/route.ts` - Removed premature marking
4. ✅ `components/Admin/Question.tsx` - Added stats display & refresh

### Database Objects:

1. ✅ `question_stats` table - Central analytics for all questions
2. ✅ `mark_question_as_used()` function - Updates `last_used_at`
3. ✅ `update_question_stats()` function - Updates statistics
4. ✅ Indexes on both `questions` and `competition_questions` tables

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Competition vs Free Quiz Differences:

| Feature | Free Quiz | Competition |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Question Source | `questions` table | `competition_questions` table |
| ID Type | Integer (`question_id`) | UUID (`competition_question_id`) |
| Timer | 10 seconds/question | 30 seconds/question |
| Status Filter | ✅ Filters by `status=true` | ✅ Filters by `status=true` |
| Mark As Used | ✅ On display | ✅ On display |
| Stats Tracking | ✅ Working | ✅ Working |
| Response Time | ✅ Working | ✅ Working |

### Both Now Track:

- ✅ When question is displayed (not fetched)
- ✅ Correct/incorrect answers
- ✅ Skipped questions
- ✅ Response time in milliseconds
- ✅ Aggregate statistics (avg response time, correct percentage)

## 🎯 Next Steps

After testing competition fixes:

1. ✅ Verify all stats are accurate
2. ✅ Test admin panel refresh functionality
3. 🔜 Move to **Phase 2: Admin Insights & Visualization**
   - Question performance charts
   - Difficulty distribution analysis
   - Usage trends over time
   - Bulk operations
