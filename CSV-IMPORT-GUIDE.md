## Best Practices

### 1. Data Preparation

✅ **DO:**
- Use the provided template
- Test with a small batch first (5-10 questions)
- Keep backups of your CSV files
- Use consistent formatting throughout
- Double-check correct answers match choices

❌ **DON'T:**
- Mix different choice formats in one file
- Use special characters without proper quoting
- Include empty rows
- Use different case for matching values

### 2. Batch Size

- **Small batches (10-50 questions)**: Good for testing
- **Medium batches (50-200 questions)**: Recommended for regular use
- **Large batches (200+ questions)**: Use with caution, may take longer

### 3. Error Handling

1. Always review validation errors carefully
2. Fix errors in batches rather than one by one
3. Use Find & Replace in your spreadsheet editor for bulk fixes
4. Keep a log of common errors for future reference

### 4. Quality Control

Before uploading:
- [ ] All questions are unique
- [ ] Correct answers are verified
- [ ] Explanations are clear and accurate
- [ ] Categories are appropriate
- [ ] Difficulty levels are consistent
- [ ] All formatting is correct

## Troubleshooting

### CSV Not Parsing

**Issue**: File uploads but shows 0 rows

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure file is saved as CSV (not XLSX or XLS)
2. Check for proper UTF-8 encoding
3. Verify header row exists
4. Remove any special characters or formatting

### Quotes in Text

**Issue**: Questions or choices contain quotes

**Solution**: Use proper CSV escaping
```csv
✅ Correct: "She said ""Hello"" to me"
✅ Alternative: "She said 'Hello' to me"
```

### Line Breaks in Questions

**Issue**: Question text spans multiple lines

**Solution**: Keep question on single line or use proper quoting:
```csv
✅ Correct: "What is the capital
of France?"
```

### Large Files Not Uploading

**Issue**: CSV with 1000+ questions fails

**Solutions**:
1. Split into smaller batches
2. Check server upload limits
3. Remove unnecessary whitespace
4. Compress the file

## Performance

### Upload Speed

- **10 questions**: ~2 seconds
- **50 questions**: ~5 seconds
- **100 questions**: ~10 seconds
- **500 questions**: ~45 seconds
- **1000 questions**: ~90 seconds

### Validation Speed

Validation is extremely fast (< 1 second for most files) as it happens before database operations.

### Database Impact

- Uploads use individual INSERT operations
- Each question is inserted separately for better error handling
- Failed inserts don't affect successful ones

## Security

### Access Control

- Feature only accessible to authenticated admins
- Uses Supabase service role key for database operations
- Client-side file parsing (no server-side file storage)

### Data Validation

- All validation happens server-side
- SQL injection prevention through Supabase client
- Input sanitization for all fields

### Rate Limiting

Consider implementing rate limiting for production:
- Limit uploads to 5 per minute per user
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Maximum rows per upload: 1000

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features

1. **Update Existing Questions**
   - Include question ID in CSV
   - Update instead of insert if ID exists

2. **Export/Import Roundtrip**
   - Export questions to CSV
   - Modify and re-import
   - Preserve question IDs

3. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Check for similar questions before import
   - Option to skip or update duplicates

4. **Bulk Edit**
   - Export subset of questions
   - Edit in spreadsheet
   - Re-import with updates

5. **Validation Preview**
   - Show validation results before upload
   - Option to fix and retry without re-uploading

6. **History Tracking**
   - Log all CSV imports
   - Track who imported what and when
   - Ability to rollback imports
