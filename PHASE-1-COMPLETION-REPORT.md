## ✅ Completed Tasks

### **Database Layer (100% Complete)**

#### 1. ✅ Migration Files Created
All migration files have been created in `db/migrations/`:

- **`2025-10-14-add-last-used-status-competition-questions.sql`**
  - Added `last_used_at` column to `competition_questions`
  - Added `status` column (boolean) for enable/disable functionality
  - Created indexes for performance optimization

- **`2025-10-14-add-last-used-status-questions.sql`**
  - Added `last_used_at` column to `questions` (free quiz)

  - Created indexes for performance optimization

- **`2025-10-14-create-question-stats-table.sql`**
  - Created `question_stats` table with:
    - Usage metrics (times_used, times_answered, times_skipped)
    - Performance metrics (times_correct, times_incorrect, correct_percentage)
    - Response time tracking (avg_response_time_ms, total_response_time_ms)
    - Foreign keys to both `questions` and `competition_questions`

- **`2025-10-14-create-update-stats-function.sql`**

  - Works for both question types

#### 2. ✅ Database Schema Updates
- **`competition_questions` table:**
  - `last_used_at` (TIMESTAMP) - tracks when question was last served
  - `status` (BOOLEAN) - TRUE = active, FALSE = disabled

- ✅ Tracks question rotation automatically

**File: `app/api/competition-questions/route.ts`**
- ✅ Now fetches only active questions (`status = true`)
- ✅ Calls `mark_question_as_used()` for each question served

#### 4. ✅ New API Endpoint Created

**File: `app/api/track-answer-stats/route.ts`**
- ✅ New endpoint to track answer statistics
- ✅ Accepts: question_id, competition_question_id, is_correct, was_skipped, response_time_ms
- ✅ Calls `update_question_stats()` function
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

---

### **Frontend Layer (100% Complete)**

#### 5. ✅ League Component Updated

**File: `components/league.tsx`**
- ✅ Integrated stats tracking on answer submission

- ✅ Error handling for failed stats tracking (non-blocking)

#### 6. ✅ Admin Question Bank Enhanced

**File: `components/Admin/Question.tsx`**

**New Features Added:**
- ✅ **Status Toggle Column**
  - Shows "✓ Active" (green) or "✗ Disabled" (red)
  - Click to enable/disable questions
  - Updates database immediately
  - Visual feedback with color coding

- ✅ **Statistics Column**

  - Shows correct percentage (color-coded: green ≥70%, yellow ≥40%, red <40%)
  - Shows average response time in seconds
  - "No data" for questions without stats

- ✅ **Last Used Column**
  - Shows date and time of last use
  - "Never used" for new questions

);
```

### `update_question_stats()`
```sql
-- Call when user answers a question

   - Questions with low correct % (need review)

2. ✅ Add charts and graphs:
   - Difficulty distribution pie chart
   - Correct % trends over time
   - Response time distribution

3. ✅ Rotation visualization:
   - Show last 10-20 questions used
   - Identify questions that haven't been used recently
