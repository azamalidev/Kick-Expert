## üîç Quality Detection Algorithm

### Thresholds Defined:

```typescript
const QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
  CRITICAL_CORRECT_PERCENTAGE: 30,    // < 30% = Critical
  CRITICAL_MIN_USES: 50,               // Need 50+ uses to flag
  WARNING_CORRECT_PERCENTAGE: 50,     // < 50% = Warning
  WARNING_MIN_USES: 20,                // Need 20+ uses to flag
  TOO_EASY_PERCENTAGE: 95,             // > 95% = Too Easy
  TOO_EASY_MIN_USES: 50,               // Need 50+ uses to flag
  SLOW_RESPONSE_TIME_MS: 60000,        // > 60 seconds = Slow
  HIGH_SKIP_RATE: 40,                  // > 40% skip rate = High Skip
  UNUSED_DAYS: 30                      // Not used in 30+ days = Unused
};
```

### Detection Logic:

Each question is analyzed for:
1. **Critical Issues** - Extremely low performance (< 30% correct)
2. **Warning Issues** - Below target performance (< 50% correct)
3. **Too Easy** - Answer too obvious (> 95% correct)
4. **Slow Response** - Takes too long (> 60 seconds)
5. **High Skip Rate** - Frequently skipped (> 40%)
6. **Unused** - Not rotated in 30+ days
