2. `POST /api/admin/question-analytics` - Bulk operations

**Query Parameters:**
- source, category, difficulty
- minCorrect, maxCorrect, minUsage
- status

**Operations Supported:**
- bulk_enable, bulk_disable
- bulk_delete, bulk_update

### Frontend Layer

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied

1. **Database Indexes**
   ```sql
   idx_question_stats_performance
   idx_question_stats_last_updated
   ```

2. **View Materialization**
   - Consider materialized view for large datasets (10,000+ questions)
   - Refresh strategy: hourly or on-demand

3. **API Response Caching**
   - Future: Add Redis/memory cache
   - TTL: 5 minutes for insights

4. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Recharts renders on demand
   - Pagination limits table rows
   - Conditional rendering for heavy components

### Performance Metrics

| Operation | Expected Time |
|-----------|--------------|
| Load Insights Tab | < 2s |
| Fetch Analytics | < 500ms |
| Render Charts | < 1s |
| Bulk Enable (100) | < 3s |
| Export CSV | < 1s |
| Export JSON | < 1s |
